Prime Number Sample

The purpose of this sample app is to demonstrate how to use App Link to let users to share your app.

This app is not relying on Facebook SDK.  Users share the views by paste the app links to other apps (e.g facebook, quip, etc).

The App use Bolts framework which provides useful functions to support App Link, it is possible you don't use it at all.

If you don't want to use Bolts, what you need to do to parse the incoming app link are:
  1. extract string value of "al_applink_data" from [url query] by seperating it with @"&" then @"="
  2. URL decode the string value with: NSString stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding
  3. JSON decode the string into NSDictionary by: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error
  4. get value for key @"target_url" from the NSDictionary, which is generated and understandable by your app
  5. parse the target_url to instanciate your view controllers and navigation controllers to open.
