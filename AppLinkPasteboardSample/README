Install instructions:

This app depends on Facebook SDK, because of demo of using Facebook indexing service.
As facebook applink index service is just one implementation for resolving applink, it is actually not required to work with AppLinks.
As You may need to fix the framework path by deleting it and re-adding from where FacebookSDK.framework installed (usually it is in ~/Documents/FacebookSDK)
To install Facebook SDK: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/

This sample app depends on Bolts-iOS,  however, if you have latest Facebook SDK, bolts is already included in.

If you don't use facebook sdk and you want to try out Bolts separately, BoltsFramework is on github:
Bolts-iOS: https://github.com/BoltsFramework/Bolts-iOS

You will need to build it with scripts/build_framework.sh and drag the framework from ./build/ios to your application.
